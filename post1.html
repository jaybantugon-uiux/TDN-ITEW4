                        <p>The tariffs would hit as Hollywood continues to navigate one of the most difficult periods in its history, as social media, changing tastes and habits among viewers, the dawn of artificial intelligence, and the fallout from the writers strike have rattled the industry — and crimped box-office returns. Last year’s box office totaled just $8.75 billion, a 3% decline from 2023 and well off the $11 billion pre-pandemic average.   </p>
                        <p>And by noon Monday, White House officials clarified that “no final decisions” had been made and that it was “exploring all options.” </p>
                        <p>Trump’s initial proposal, posted to Truth Social, called for tariffs “on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” citing what he said was the harmful impact of incentives being offered by other countries.   </p>
                        <p>“WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN,” Trump wrote.  </p>
                        <p>Speaking from the Oval Office just before 2 p.m. Monday, Trump said he would be meeting with industry officials to make sure they were "happy" with his tariffs plan.</p>
                        <p>"I’m not looking to hurt the industry; I'm looking to help," he said.
                            Industry officials and observers did not respond well to the initial plan. In a note to clients, analysts with Morgan Stanley called the idea “ill-defined,” noting 100% duties on some or all of the cost of a Hollywood production “would lead to fewer films, more expensive films, and lower earnings for all in the business.” </p>

                        <p>“The reality is that for any given film, there can be writing, production, editing, post-production, visual effects — all done in different countries,” they wrote.
                            The analysts noted Trump’s proposal failed to mention whether the tariffs would also apply to TV productions, what aspect of a production would be tariffed and how it would be charged, and whether the tariffs could be applied retroactively.</p>
